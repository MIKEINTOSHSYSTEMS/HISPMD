## User Roles and Permissions

HISPMD uses a **role-based access control** system to ensure that users can only access the features and data relevant to their responsibilities.

| Role       | Permissions |
|------------|------------|
| **Admin** | Full access, including user management, data configuration, and system settings. |
| **Data Manager** | Can enter, view, and analyze data, generate reports, download/export, and apply filters but cannot modify system settings or manage users. |
| **Default** | Read-only access to dashboards and reports, ability to download/export without the ability to modify data or settings. |
| **M&E** | Can see all the data manager can access but cannot edit them. |

### Changing User Roles
- **Only Admins** can assign or modify user roles.
- If you require additional access, contact your system administrator.

Now that you have logged in and understand your user role, you can start exploring the dashboard's features. Continue to **Dashboard Navigation** for an overview of how to interact with HISPMD. ðŸš€
