This section provides users with a guide to resolving common issues that may arise while using the Health Information Systems Performance Monitoring Dashboard (HISPMD). Additionally, it outlines the available support channels for when issues cannot be resolved independently.

## 9.1 Common Issues and Fixes

### Accessing Knowledge Base
A user can access the Knowledge Base articles and search for common ways of using HISPMD with self-guided articles and instructions. This module will help the user navigate and troubleshoot common issues.

This can be done by going to the left side menu or on the start page by clicking on the menu item **[Knowledge Base]**.

Privileged users can **Add** and **Edit** Knowledge articles and contents. Users can find KB articles by selecting categories or searching through the KB search page.

### 1. Forgot Password

**Issue:**  
Users may forget their login password and are unable to access the dashboard.

**Solution:**  
1. On the login page, click on the "Forgot Password?" link.
2. Enter your registered email address.
3. You will receive a password reset link in your inbox. Follow the instructions provided in the email to create a new password.
4. Once reset, use the new password to log into the system.

> **Note:** If you do not receive the password reset email within a few minutes, check your Spam or Junk folder.

### 2. Data Not Loading

**Issue:**  
Sometimes data may not load, or there could be a delay in fetching or displaying the data on the dashboard.

**Solution:**  
1. **Check Your Internet Connection:** Ensure that your device has an active internet connection.
2. **Reload the Page:** Refresh the page by pressing F5 or clicking the refresh icon in your browser.
3. **Clear Browser Cache:** Sometimes cached data can interfere with the loading of the latest data. Clear your browser's cache and cookies, then try reloading the page.
4. **Check for Server Issues:** If the above steps do not work, there may be a server issue. In this case, contact the system administrator.

> **Tip:** If the issue persists over a prolonged period, it could be related to server-side or network performance issues.

### 3. Access Denied

**Issue:**  
You may encounter an **Access Denied** error if you do not have the appropriate permissions to access a specific section of the dashboard.

**Solution:**  
1. **Verify User Permissions:** Ensure that your account has the correct permissions to access the section or data.
2. **Contact the Admin:** If you are unsure about your access level, contact your system administrator or a user with administrative privileges to adjust your permissions.
3. **Check for System Maintenance:** If you cannot access any features or modules, it could be due to system maintenance. Check for any scheduled maintenance announcements.
