## 5. Indicator Analysis

### 5.1 Overview of Indicator Analysis in HISPMD

Indicator analysis in the **Health Information Systems Performance Monitoring Dashboard (HISPMD)** allows users to assess health system performance based on key metrics. Indicators measure health outcomes, service coverage, and system efficiency, helping decision-makers:

- Evaluate progress toward health goals and targets.
- Identify gaps and areas requiring intervention.
- Compare performance across time, regions, and facility types.
- Support evidence-based decision-making.

HISPMD provides **interactive tools** to analyze and interpret indicator data, offering multiple views, filtering options, and comparisons.
