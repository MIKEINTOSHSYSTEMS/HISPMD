2. Under **Regional Settings**, select the appropriate time zone from the list.

3. Set the default date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY).

4. Click **Save Changes**.

## 8.3 User Management and Security Configuration
In addition to managing users, administrators can configure security settings that protect the system and ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.

### 8.3.1 Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA ensures that users provide additional verification beyond just their passwords, significantly enhancing security.

**Steps to Enable MFA:**
1. Navigate to the **Security Settings** in your Profile section.

2. Under **Authentication**, toggle the MFA setting to **Enabled**.

3. Choose the method of verification (SMS, Email, or Authenticator App).

4. Click **Save 2FA Changes**.

**ðŸ”¹ MFA Methods:**
- **Email-based OTP:** A one-time passcode sent to the user's email.

- **SMS-based OTP:** A passcode sent to the user's phone. [TBD]

- **Authenticator Apps:** Apps like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator can generate OTPs.

### 8.3.2 Password Policy Configuration
The password policy defines the requirements for user account passwords to ensure that passwords are strong enough to protect sensitive data.

**Steps to Configure Password Policies:**
1. Go to **Password Settings** under **Security Configuration**.

2. Set the minimum password length (e.g., 8 characters).

3. Enforce complexity requirements (e.g., requiring uppercase, numbers, and special characters).

4. Set password expiration (e.g., 90 days).

5. Enable or disable account lockout after a set number of failed login attempts.

6. Save the changes to enforce the password policy.

## 8.4 Data Management Settings
The Data Management settings provide options for configuring the way health data is handled, including data synchronization, retention policies, and backup procedures.

### 8.4.1 Configuring Data Synchronization
To ensure that HISPMD is continuously updated with the latest health data, administrators can configure data synchronization settings.

**Steps to Set Up Data Sync:**
1. Go to **Data Synchronization Settings**.

2. Choose the synchronization frequency (e.g., hourly, daily, or weekly).

3. Configure data sources and endpoints for synchronization.

4. Click **Save Changes** to begin the synchronization process.
<br></br>

> ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Data synchronization settings help keep the system up-to-date with real-time data from external systems or APIs.

### 8.4.2 Backup and Data Retention Policies
Setting up automatic data backups and retention policies ensures that data is securely stored and can be recovered in case of a failure.

**Steps to Configure Backup Settings:**

1. Navigate to **Backup Settings** under **Data Management**.

2. Enable automatic backups and specify the backup frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).

3. Choose the location where backups should be stored (e.g., cloud storage, local server).

4. Set the data retention period to specify how long backups should be kept before they are archived or deleted.

5. Save the changes to activate the backup schedule.

<br></br>
**ðŸ”¹ Tip:** Regular backups protect against data loss and ensure continuity in case of system failure.

## 8.5 System Integrations and API Configuration
HISPMD supports seamless integration with other healthcare systems, APIs, and external databases. Administrators can configure these integrations to enhance data flow and interoperability.

### 8.5.1 Configuring External System Integrations
Administrators can integrate HISPMD with various external systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), laboratory information systems, or reporting tools.

**Steps to Configure API Integrations:**
1. Navigate to **Integrations** in the system settings.

2. Choose the external system you want to integrate with (e.g., EHR, DHIS2).

3. Enter the required API endpoint, API key, and other configuration details.

4. Click **Test Connection** to verify the integration.

5. Save the settings to enable the integration.

### 8.5.2 API Key Management
